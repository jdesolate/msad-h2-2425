            <p>Hello! I'm Elle Gabrielle Bernante, a Computer Engineering student who enjoys cooking, traveling, and spending time with loved ones.</p>
            <p>My family fondly calls me G, my friends know me as EG, orgmates refer to me as Berns, and in class, I'm recognized as Elle or L. 
                Lapu-Lapu City is my birthplace, and I owe my earliest memories to my grandparents, who took care of me. I moved to Danao city and studied there until Junior high school before returning to Lapu-Lapu City for senior high school. 
                I resided in Mandaue City with my parents for arounnd two years and now, I am back in Lapu-Lapu City. </p>
            <p>In my free time, I love baking new recipes, video streaming, and talking to my friends. I'm also passionate about personal development and learning new skills.</p>

                    and baby cologne on the floor which made it slippery. We then played like it was a skating rink. 
                    It was such a fun memory that we still look back to it up to this day.
