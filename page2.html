            <h2>Smile Down the Runway – A Beautiful Reminder to Chase the Dream</h2>

                        I didn't expect Smile Down the Runway (Runway de Waratte) to hit me this hard. At its core, Smile Down the Runway is about rejection. It's about people who desperately want something—success, recognition, a place in the world of fashion—but are constantly reminded that dreams alone aren't enough. 
                        The industry is ruthless, talent is never guaranteed success, and even passion gets trampled. Still, the characters push forward. And watching them do that? It made me hurt in the best way possible. 
                        Even if you don't care about fashion, this anime has a strange power. The way it portrays struggle is so raw, you can't help but root for everyone—even the so-called antagonists. Everyone's got a burden, and Runway de Waratte isn't afraid to show you just how heavy they are. 
                        Is it perfect? No. The comedy can be hit or miss, and some proportions in the art are hilariously unrealistic—but it's anime. It works. The heart of the story—the characters, their tears, and their fire—makes everything else fade away. 
                        What's also very fascininating about this show is that it tackles real problems in the fashion industry, and also teaches the viewers obscure or niche topics centered around clothing. 
                        Protect Chiyuki at all costs.

            <h2>Girls' Last Tour – A Quiet Journey Through the End</h2>

                    <p class="description-2">
                        Girls' Last Tour stands out in a genre dominated by chaos and conflict. While most post-apocalyptic stories lean into violence and action (Fist of the North Star, Mad Max), this manga quietly contemplates the ruins of a forgotten world through the eyes of two girls: Chito and Yuuri. 
                        There's no grand war to fight—just questions. Why did the world fall? What did humanity leave behind? With each chapter, the story explores themes like religion, art, war, and the fleeting nature of joy. Chito and Yuuri are naïve to history, surviving with scraps of knowledge, making their reflections all the more poignant. 
                        Despite the bleak setting, the manga balances somber reflection with peaceful, sometimes comedic moments—like when the girls discover alcohol and briefly forget the emptiness around them. These moments give weight to their emotional journey and make the story feel human.
                        The anime enhances this beautifully. Scenes like The Sound of Rain go beyond the page, using sound and animation to breathe life into quiet wonder. It's not just about survival—it's about finding meaning in a world that has none left. 
                        If you're looking for action, this isn't it. But if you want a thoughtful, melancholic, and emotionally rich story, Girls' Last Tour is a 9/10 must-read (and must-watch). It's haunting, simple, and deeply unforgettable.

                        Ender Lilies is a souls-like metroidvania that excels in atmosphere, sound design, music, and storytelling. You play as the White Priestess, cast into the unforgiving world of Land's End, a kingdom devastated by the Rain of Death. As you traverse this desolate land, purifying blighted spirits and adding them to your arsenal—with the aid of your enigmatic companion, the Umbral Knight—the game crafts a deeply immersive and memorable experience. 
                        Taking clear inspiration from Dark Souls, Ender Lilies places you in a dark fantasy world where most of its inhabitants are either dead or corrupted. The gameplay is engaging, offering a variety of spirit combinations that open up different combat styles and strategies, allowing for experimentation and personalization. 
                        However, the standout feature of the game is its breathtaking soundtrack, composed by Mili. Each track beautifully enhances the atmosphere, echoing the emotions of the environment—from melancholic and somber melodies to eerie, unsettling tones. The music doesn't just accompany the game—it elevates it, perfectly complementing its subtle yet impactful storytelling. 
                        Ender Lilies isn't just a game—it's an emotional, artistic journey that stays with you long after the credits roll.

                        Stepping away from the dark fantasy world of Ender Lilies, Slime Rancher offers a vibrant and whimsical escape as you take on the role of a rancher on a distant planet filled with adorable, bouncing slimes.
                        The game delivers a relaxing and lighthearted experience, where wrangling slimes and basking in their cuteness becomes both charming and rewarding. 
                        While the gameplay may seem simple at first glance, it's enriched with scattered pieces of lore—offering insight into the world, the ranchers who came before you, and the protagonist's own story, including their relationships and life back home. 
                        It's a gentle, thoughtful adventure wrapped in a colorful and cheerful atmosphere.

                        Set in the roaring 1920s, The Great Gatsby is more than just a love story—it's a reflection of a society obsessed with wealth, image, and illusion. Told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, the novel introduces us to Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire who throws extravagant parties in hopes of reuniting with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan.
                        Gatsby and Daisy once shared a romance, but time, class, and marriage pulled them apart. Now, Gatsby clings to the dream of rekindling what they had, blind to how much both he and Daisy have changed. Their fleeting moments together are tender but tinged with denial—he sees the past as something he can recreate, but reality tells another story.
                        What makes the novel powerful isn't just the doomed romance, but how it captures the hollowness of high society. The characters are flawed, selfish, and often hard to root for, yet that’s what makes them feel real. The world Fitzgerald builds is dazzling and cruel, where love is just another illusion sold under the glimmer of jazz and champagne.
                        I watched part of the film adaptation before reading the book, and it actually helped me visualize the setting better. Still, the novel stood strong on its own—elegantly written, emotionally layered, and quietly tragic. It’s a story that doesn’t just tell you about a lost love, but about a dream that was never really possible to begin with.
