        <h2>My Personality Type </h2>
        <p><strong>MBTI Type:</strong> INFJ-T (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging â€“ Turbulent)</p>
        <p>As an INFJ-T, I tend to be thoughtful, and empathetic. I value close relationships and enjoy meaningful conversations with people I trust. I love learning new things, exploring ideas, and trying new experiencesâ€”especially with the people I care about. </p>

        <h2>What Iâ€™m Passionate About </h2>
        <p>Honestly, I donâ€™t have a clear passionâ€”I just focus on what makes me happy & safe. Being with my family, friends, and loved ones is more than enough. Trying new things with them, indoors or outdoors, makes every experience special. Also to graduate and find a fulfilling job that aligns with my values and interests.</p>

        <h2>Things I Love Doing </h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing games while maintaining discipline by setting time limits. After gaming, I spend my time doing assignments, activities, and studying. Learning how to build HTML and CSS websites sparked my interestâ€”I hope that one day, Iâ€™ll create my own awesome site with more advanced and dynamic features using the knowledge I gained. </p>
